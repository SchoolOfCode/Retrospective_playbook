# Retrospective playbook
A playbook containing links and/or descriptions of several different types of Retrospectives which can be run within Agile teams

1. [4 L's; Liked, Learned, Lacked, Longed for](./Retrospectives/4_Ls.md)


2. [Lean Coffee](./Retrospectives/Lean_Coffee.md)


3. [K.A.L.M.](./Retrospectives/KALM.md)


4. [Speed Car](./Restrospectives/Speed_Car.md)


5. [Start, Stop, Continue](./Retrospectives/Start_Stop_Continue.md)


       These are not the only types of Retro out there in Agile-land, but they cover a basic swath of styles of questioning.

       As with anything in Agile you should pick what works best for your team. 

       But never be afraid to Experiment!!

# Start, Stop, and Continue
```
Don't focus on habits which are embedded and good, focus on things which need to become habits or need to stop being done.
```

### Approach the Start line

## What you need
- A board with three columns 'Start', 'Stop', 'Continue'
- A way for team members to add items to the board

## The play
1. Review the last SSC meeting and move items from those `Start` and `Stop` columns into the `Continue` column on this board.
   
2. Spend 5-10 minutes adding new items to each column (including `Continue` if you feel something has been missed).

3. Vote on which items to discuss first.


### Start
- What should the team *add* to it's process?
- What could be done differently?
- What might help us in the long run?

`Examples`

    - Show software to customers quickly/early
    - Do code reviews
    - Be on time to stand ups
  
### Stop 
- What things are inefficient?
- What things are negatively impacting the team from achieving their Focus?

`Examples`
    - Checking in code with running tests locally
    - Too many meetings

### Continue
- What are we already doing but haven't yet become habits?
- These are possibly items which had been in **Start** a few retrospectives ago.
- Once an item is embedded as a habit the team doesn't need to keep checking in on it in the **Continue** column, otherwise the list will be huge


## Tips
The facilitator can try phrasing the questions in different ways to prompt different discussions and ideas.

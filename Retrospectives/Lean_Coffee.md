## What you need
- A board with four (4) columns on it; whether that be Trello, a virtual whiteboard, or a piece of paper with post-its.
- The ability to Vote on cards
- Headings to each column
- 5-10 minutes of writing time
- 15-30 minutes of discussion time

## Aims
To allow the team more free-form discussions and decide how much time they want to devote to topics democratically.

## The Play 
1. Set up the board with Five (5) columns 'Glad', 'Sad', 'Mad', 'Discussing', 'Actions'

- Mad: Things that the team found frustrating
- Sad: Things that the team found disappointing
- Glad: Things that made the team happy and excited


2. The team spends 5-10 minutes brainstorming and adding cards to any of the first Three (3) columns.


3. The team groups or removes any duplicates


4. The team is assigned a number of votes (between 1-3 depending on the number of cards/participants). They then add a vote to each card they want to discuss.


5. Cards are ranked based on the number of votes, and then they are moved into the "Discussing" column one at a time starting with the top voted card from any column. `These absolutely can be cards from the "Glad" column, everything is worth discussing if the team voted for it.`


6. Discussion is timeboxed to 5 minutes.


7. After 5 minutes of discussion, the team are asked whether they would like to keep discussing (at which point they get another 5 minute timebox discussion) or whether they would like to write up an action from it.


8. Not all cards need to be discussed, not even all cards with votes on need to be discussed. Set yourselves a maximum timelimit for discussions of about 20 minutes. **If something is still important enough to raise again the team can create another retro to discuss it, or the card will return naturally in the next retrospective anyway.**

## The play
1. Ask the participants to write notes and place them either in "Go Fast" (Engine) or "Slow down" (Parachute)

2. **Engine**: What things have pushed us forward? What things are we doing which allows us to move faster?

3. **Parachute**: What has been slowing us down?

4. Group the Notes and Discuss
